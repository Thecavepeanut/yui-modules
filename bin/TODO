date/time
	enforce date & time formats in DateTime.js - don't rely on Y.Calendar
		range: end is not enforcing time portion of blackout range

	option to provide starting set of rules and filterFn
		how does "all" interact with individual rules?

	test resetDateTime()

	test with gallery-timepicker
		render in Y.Overlay
		placement algorithm from custom DT2 cell editor?

	test with 12-hour time:  AM/PM

	test with date format: d/m/y
		probably incompatible with type="date" in Chrome

	setting type="time" to zero blanks it instead of setting to 12:00AM

date/time range
	test shifting min/max by enough so there is no overlap between orig and new ranges
		test shifting both earlier and later

convert leibnitz about.xpm to apple-touch-icon.png and add to yui3-gallery/mathcanvas

scrollIntoView
	x/y offset -- only applied at top level

accordion: fixed-width: horizontal doesn't fit correctly
	Firefox only
	2px too wide, no matter how many open sections

state:  need diffState to make it easy to compare states
