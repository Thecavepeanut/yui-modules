date/time
	enforce date & time formats in DateTime.js - don't rely on Y.Calendar
		enforceDateTimeLimits() gives up because this.getDateTime() returns false

		w/out calendar:
			need to store last valid date, so can revert if new value is invalid
			DateTime doesn't know about calendar, so needs to work either way

		type "3a" in time field or in date field w/out calendar
		range: end is not enforcing time portion of blackout range

	option to provide starting set of rules and filterFn
		how does "all" interact with individual rules?

	implement setDateTime()
	test resetDateTime()

	test with gallery-timepicker
		render in Y.Overlay
		placement algorithm from custom DT2 cell editor?

	test with 12-hour time:  AM/PM

	test with date format: d/m/y
		probably incompatible with type="date" in Chrome

	setting type="time" to zero blanks it instead of setting to 12:00AM

date/time range
	test shifting min/max by enough so there is no overlap between orig and new ranges
		test shifting both earlier and later
